Learning Path
---------------------------------------------

1. Python Programming.
2. Data Wrangling - pandas and numpy.
3. Visualization libraries such as matplotlib, seaborn, plotly, and mapbox.
4. Statistics, probability and hypothesis testing.
5. Dashboard creation using Google Data Studio.
6. Machine learning algorithms such as linear regressions, logistics regressions, SVM, 
   Naive Bayes, Random Forest and etc.
7. Deep learning.
8. Unsupervised learning where we create look at clusters and segmentation systems
9. Big data using PySpark
10. Deployment into production using Cloud Services (create an ML API)

Data Analysts
---------------------------------------------
- Data analysts translate raw numbers into comprehensible reports and/or insights.
- As we know, all businesses potentially collects data, from sales figures, market research, logistics, or transportation costs.
- Data analysts take that data and use it to help companies make better business decisions.
- They often can create simple visual illustrations and charts to convey the meaning in their data
- This could mean figuring out trends in cash flow, how to schedule employees, optimal pricing and more.

Examples: Analytics, Metrics, Segments, Aggregates, Features, Training Data,
          Cleaning , Nomaly Detection, PREP.

---------------------------------------------
Data Engineers
---------------------------------------------
Data engineers connect all parts of the data ecosystem within a company or institution and make it accessible.
- Accessing, collecting, auditing, and learning data from applications and
  systems into a usable state (ETL pipelines).
- Creating, choosing and maintaining efficient databases.
- Building data pipelines taking data from one system to next.
- Monitoring and managing all the data systems (scalability, security, DevOps)
- Deploying Data Scientists' models.
- They work with production and understand Big Data concepts.

Examples: Reliable Data Flow, Infrastructure, Pipelines, ETL, Structured and Unstructured Data Storage,
          Instrumentation, Logging, Sensors, External Data, User Generated Content.

---------------------------------------------
Data Scientists
---------------------------------------------
- Clean up and pre-process (data wrangling) data from various systems in usable data for use in their algorithms.
- Using machine learning and deep learning to build better predictive models.
- Evaluating statistical models and results to determine the validity of analysis.
- Testing and continuously improving the accuracy of machine learning models.
- Much like Data Analysts, Data Scientists building data visualizations to summarize the conclusion of an advanced analysis.

Examples: AI, Deep Learning, A/B Testing, Experimentation, Simple ML Algorithms.
